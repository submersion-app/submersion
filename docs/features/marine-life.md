| **Category Breakdown** | By species type |

### Species History

For each species, view:
- Total sightings count
- Number of dives with sighting
- First sighting date
- Sites where seen
- Depth range observed

## Site-Species Correlation

### What Lives Where

Discover patterns:
- Which species at which sites
- Seasonal variations
- Depth preferences

### Site Species List

Each dive site shows:
- Species seen there
- Sighting frequency
- Best depth for species

## Photo Integration

### Species Photos

Add reference photos:
- Database photos for ID
- Your photos for personal sightings
- Before/after comparisons

<div class="tip">
<strong>Coming Soon:</strong> Photo management with per-sighting images will be available in v2.0.

## Identification Tips

### Recording Details

Good sighting records include:
- Accurate species ID
- Behavior observed
- Size estimate
- Depth where seen
- Any unusual features

### Uncertain IDs

If unsure of species:
- Add to "Other" category
- Note distinguishing features
- Update later when identified

## Conservation Notes

### Tracking Rare Species

Flag notable sightings:
- Endangered species
- Unusual behavior
- Out-of-range sightings
- Breeding behavior

### Environmental Changes

Track over time:
- Species diversity changes
- Coral health observations
- Invasive species
- Bleaching events

## Export & Sharing

### Sighting Data

Export sighting data:
- Included in UDDF export
- Available in CSV export
- For citizen science projects

### Contributing Data

Consider sharing:
- Reef monitoring programs
- Shark sighting databases
- Manta ray identification
- Whale shark registries

## Best Practices

1. **ID before logging** - Be confident in identification
2. **Count accurately** - Estimate when schools are large
3. **Note behavior** - Feeding, cleaning, mating
4. **Include context** - Depth, substrate, time of day
5. **Update records** - Correct misidentifications
6. **Learn continuously** - Use field guides
